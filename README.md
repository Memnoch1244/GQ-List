- Refreshes every server tick.
- Quests are color coded according to your level.
- Left-click a GQ to show the "gq info" for that quest.
- Right-click a GQ to "gq join" that quest.
- Toggle sound notifications on/off for GQs in level range.
- Auto toggle window to only show when GQ is in level range.
- Show/hide the window with "gqshow" and "gqhide".
- Sending "gq list" will still echo the command in the main window.

Plans:  
- Add config to only show quests in or just above your range.
